================================================= 
3. Procedure to get a specific version of Warrior
=================================================

1. Clone warriorframework

     $ git clone https://github.com/warriorframework/warriorframework.git

2. Go to warriorframework directory

     $cd warriorframework

3. To check the list of versions available, execute "git tag --list" command

     $ git tag --list 
	 warrior-3.1.0
	 warrior-3.1.1
	 warrior-3.2.0
	 warrior-3.3.0
	 warrior-3.3.1
	 warrior-3.4.0
	 warrior-3.5.0
	 warrior-3.6.0
	 warrior-3.7.0
	 warrior-3.8.0
	 warrior-3.9.0
	 warrior-3.9.1
	 warrior-3.10.0

4. To Check the current version you are at, execute "git branch" command
     $ git branch 
	 * master 
     - * indicates the active version.
	 - In the above example master is the active version.
	 - If the active version is master it means you are not using a standard release version of warrior framework
	 and hence it may not be a stable tested version.

5. To switch to a specific version from master, execute 'git checkout <version_name>' command.

    $ git checkout warrior-3.10.0
	 Note: checking out 'warrior-3.10.0'.

	You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
	changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
	state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

	If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
	do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again.
	Example:

	git checkout -b new_branch_name

	HEAD is now at abcba40... update version and release_notes for hotfix-3.10.0
	
	

6. Execute git branch command to verify the active version.
	$ git branch 
	* (detached from warrior-3.10.0) master	
	- * indicates the active version.

7. Switch from one version to another (current=warrior-3.10.0, switch to warrior-3.9.0)
    $git checkout warrior-3.9.0
	Previous HEAD position was 6cea565... Update version.txt
    HEAD is now at ba0fdc8... Update version.txt
	$git branch
    * (detached from warrior-3.10.0)
	master	

8. Switch to master branch again.

   $ git checkout master 
    Previous HEAD position was ba0fdc8... Update version.txt
    Switched to branch 'master'
     
   $ git branch
   * master
